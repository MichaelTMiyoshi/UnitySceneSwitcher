# UnitySceneSwitcher
Unity project that shows how to switch from one scene to another with a button.  (School project)

Simple project to show the results of following the [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSt5xrFHaFU).

### Notes:
The project has 3 scenes.  Each scene has a button.  The button makes the project go from scene 1 to scene 2 to scene 3 and then back to scene 1 when you press the buttons on the different scenes.  If you follow the tutorial, there is a section at about 8:29 in the video that is crucial.  You need to drag a game object called SceneManager from the hierarchy to the event trigger area of the button and then select the proper function to execute.  The other key is to make sure to add all the scenes to the build.
